# Service for Tracking All FIFA Matches Played Between Multiple Users

## Match Rules
1. No match can end in a draw.
2. For each match, the loser incurs a debt of â‚¬0.50 to the winner, regardless of whether the match ends in regular time, extra time, or penalties.
3. Every match must be played with two teams of equal level. The only criterion for comparison is the number of stars of the team (default FIFA rating).
4. Points will be awarded based on the following table:

| Win in 90 min   | Win in 120 min   | Win in Penalties |
|-----------------|------------------|------------------|
| 3 points        | 2 points         | 1 point          |

Goals scored and conceded are based only on regular and extra time, not penalties.
